- ðŸ‘‹ hey there, you can either call me V, or mae, whatever works best for you.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cybersecurity at the moment, but im looking to expand my horizons
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? i am fairly active on twitter at the handle @drywalleater47, you can find me on discord at the handle mae6
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/they
- âš¡ Fun fact: i started out with more of an interest in physical hardware, but at this point im more interested in the whole 9 yards, if you catch my meaning. I love seeing physical hardware interacting with well written scripts and programs, it is sort of magical to me, in a way.
